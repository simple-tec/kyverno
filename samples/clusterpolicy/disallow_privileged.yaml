    policies.kyverno.io/description: Privileged containers are defined as any 
      container where the container uid 0 is mapped to the hostâ€™s uid 0. 
      A process within a privileged container can get unrestricted host access. 
      With `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` enabled, a process can 
      gain privileges from its parent.
